# React Template 📦 ⚛️

Template for frontend applications based on ReactJS. It inspired by problems of beginning a new project when you need a quick start with an standart frontend stack (as ReactJS is) and you don't want to think about how to implements that right.

### Stack

- `ReactJS`
- `React Router`
- `TypeScript`
- `Jest`
- `Testing Library`
- `Webpack`

### Commands

- `pnpm run build` - build the app.
- `pnpm run lint` - linting of the app. With addional param like `:js` or `:css` you can lint specific files.
- `pnpm run dev` - runs dev server.

### In progress

New commands:

- `pnpm run build-stats` - create build stats `json` file for analysis.
- `pnpm run prettier:check` - tells pritter check all files and shows errors/warnings.
- `pnpm run prettier:write` - fix all errors/warnings in files.
- `pnpm run test` - runs unit tests.
